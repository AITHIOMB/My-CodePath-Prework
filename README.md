## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Brilliant: 
It is a userfriendly educational app that is quite minimalistic in its colors but highly informational, text heavy, without being overwhelming
Mimo: 
An educational app that also quite simple, user friendly, yet inviting and nonintimidating. Push notifactions and streaks inspires users to use the app more often
Instagram: 
I like the explorer page, algorithm, and layout and location of the navigation icons. 

I would like to create an app for a nonprofit that I am a member of. The app would include features such as a list of resources, emergency calling, access to affordable food and water, volunteering opportunities, and tutoring sites around the city for school aged children.

## Notes

I didn't have to use the "Adjust Editor Options" in the top right. I couldn't find it. However, i was able to use the assistant option under Editor.
App could be further improved with images and icons
